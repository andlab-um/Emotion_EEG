* Data modality: EEG (64 ch), ECG (3 leads)
* Paradigm: naturalistic viewing of negative emotinal videos under virtual reality (Unity + Steam VR)
* Main analysis method: Intersubject similarity analysis (ISC) & Intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA)
* *Note*: we used a embeded python scripts into the CS# script of Unity program to send marks to EEG & ECG hardware, which is done through the parallel port, a template scripts is provided in this repo
